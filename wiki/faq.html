			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<h1>Types of Headphones</h1>
			<p><b>Earbuds:</b> The most common type of headphones, the most popular and common example being the stock Apple Ear Pods. These headphones rest within your outer ear, but do physically enter your ear canal.<br><br>
<b>IEMs:</b> Otherwise known as in-ear monitors. These are headphones that go into your ear similar to ear buds, but they go a step further by nesting into your ear canal. They will provide a higher level of isolation due to the deeper fit and a proper seal; which also helps in bass response. The earphone tips (what you physically insert into your ear canal) come in a variety of sizes and shapes, as well as foam tips. Manufactures provide different sizes and designs. Highly suitable for portable use, especially when passive noise isolation is required.<br><br>

<b>Full-Sized, Circumaural:</b> These can be open or closed headphones, it doesn't matter. The defining characteristic of these is that they will completely surround your ear inside the pad. The pad of the headphone generally won't touch the ear, rather make a seal around the outside of the ear. Generally, these are considered to be the most comfortable headphones, but they also tend to be large and are generally not ideal for portable use. Most higher end headphones are full sized and circumaural. <Br><br>

<b>Full-Sized, Supra-aural:</b> These can be open or closed headphones, it doesn't matter. The defining characteristic of these is that they sit on the ear, rather than cover your ear. Some users find the design to be uncomfortable due to the pressure applied on the ears. Closed back supra-aural headphones generally tend to be more suitable for portable use when IEMs are not personally favorable for the user.
<Br><br>
<B>Open vs. Closed </b>

This question comes up often. Simply put; open headphones are physically open (the driver housings are physically vented), they also “leak” sound out. Closed headphones are physically sealed (the entire headphone housing is solid). Open headphones will generally have a wider sound stage, giving the music more room to breathe and usually a more realistic presentation. It can be thought of as seeing a concert outdoors where the music has an air to it. This isn't always true, but it's one way to look at it. The downfall to open headphones is that they leak sound and let sound in. This makes them poor solutions for traveling or in any environment and situation where the prevention of sound leakage as well as passive noise isolation is paramount. As a general rule of thumb, due to the soundstage advantages open back headphones exhibit vs closed back, an open back headphone will be preferable for gaming purposes. This is a key factor if specific sound positioning is of importance.<br><br>

Closed headphones generally have a less diffuse and more intimate sound presentation. A good analogy would be to think of a full size orchestra vs chamber music. Often, this is described as a more ‘in the head’ sound. Most closed back headphones also provide a level of passive noise isolation that varies from different makes and models. There are exceptions to this design as certain closed backs feature specific ventilation designed inherently into the driver housing. Due to the enclosed nature of the driver housing with closed back headphones, the reflection of sound waves from the enclosure can cause resonance that can increase overall bass and treble quantity. This does not apply to all closed back headphones and there are many exceptions.

<h1>AMPS/DACS  Explained</h1>

<p><b>What is a DAC/amp?</b>
When you play any sounds out of your computer or phone or MP3 player, they are pure digital signals in the form of 0s and 1s. In order for headphones to listen to that signal, they need a device to convert it into an analog signal. This is a Digital-to-Analog Converter, or a DAC.
A DAC by itself, however, won’t output the signal to be strong enough by itself. This is where the amplifier comes in. It amplifies the analog signal from the DAC to a level where it can be audible on the headphones.<br><br>
All sound cards, for example, typically combine the DAC, amp, and recording parts all into a single unit. DAC standalone units have the DAC, but require an amp if they want to be used with headphones. Amp standalone units will only take a signal from a DAC or output from another amp and amplify it. There are also many DAC/Amp combo units, both for portable use and desk use. 
<br><br>
<b>Should I get a standalone DAC?</b>
All modern computers have DACs and amps built into them, whether in the form of your speaker outputs on the back or the headphone audio ports. The issue is that these are typically not points where most computer companies focus on, and they typically use cheap parts there.<br><br>
Typically, a more expensive DAC will have a cleaner sound that will be closer to the actual reproduction of the music with less distortion when compared with the stock one in most laptops and computers. As great as that sounds, this is typically one of the smallest return for your $ unless your device has a poor DAC.
For example, my $300 laptop has an audible buzzing noise when I use its headphone ports. The buzzing is loud enough that it can cover up details in the music that my headphones would otherwise pick up. I can immediately hear a sound quality difference if I use an external DAC.<Br><br>
<b>Should I get a standalone amp?</b></p><br>
<p>Aftermarket amps are typically needed in one of three situations.</p><br>
<ol><li>I have a standalone DAC that needs an amp to function.</li>
<li>My headphones are not loud enough.</li>
<li>My sound card/stereo receiver/MP3 player outputs with a very high output impedance which is causing my headphones to be voiced differently than they were originally tuned.</li></ol><br>
<p>If you fall under any of these three cases, you should consider buying an amp for your headphones.<Br><br>
<B>How expensive of an amp do I need to pair with my headphones?</b>
There actually is a lot of lovely math behind this. Long story short, this article explains it far better than I could do so here. [1] Typical mobile devices will have about 0.6V of output. Computers typically have about 1V of output, but this varies wildly. Budget portable amps have an output around 1.2 – 1.9V.
Amps on the level of the $99 Schiit Magni [6.2V into 32 ohms] or $150 O2 [7.3V into 600 ohms] will power anything short of the extremely power hungry headphones (Hifiman HE-6 or AKG K1000) to reasonable volume for almost anybody.</p>
<h1>Types of amplifiers</h1>
<p>
An amplifier is a device that changes the amplitude of a signal. However, "amplifier", when used alone, is a term that can be used to refer to different components in the chain, and usage may also differ between countries. <br><br>Here are the devices:<br><br>
<b>Power amplifier</b>
This is the component that takes a low-level signal and transforms it to a high power signal, suitable for driving a loudspeaker.
In pro audio circles the term amp used alone will most often refer to power amplifiers, while among musicians, the word "amp" is often taken to mean guitar amplifier.
<br><br>
<b>Pre-amplifier</b>
In home audio terms, this is a device that connects in front of a power amp, and provides a number of functions: It provides multiple inputs, so you can connect, say, a CD player, a computer and a tape deck, and choose which source you want to listen to. It provides a volume control, and sometimes it has additional features, such as balance and tone controls, or a "loudness" button.
Note that in pro audio and recording circles, "pre-amp" can also refer to a microphone pre-amplifer that brings the low level signal of a microphone up to line level, and optionally also provide what is called phantom power to the device.
<br><br>
<b>Integrated amplifier</b>
This is simply a component where the pre- and power amp is included in the same box, and usually also with a shared power supply between the two.
<br><Br>
<b>Receiver</b>
A receiver is an integrated amplifier that has an integrated tuner. Traditionally, the tuner has been an AM/FM tuner, but these days digital options, including satellite radio, Internet radio and network playback is also often used to describe these devices
<br><br>
<b>A/V Receiver</b>
An A/V receiver is a receiver meant for home cinema use, and typically has inputs/outputs for video in addition to audio, and also typically has five or more channels of amplification. Colloquially, people may use the term "receiver" to mean "AV receiver"
<br><br>
<b>Phono pre-amp</b>
Since the signal from a turntable is radically different from a regular component such as a CD player. The voltage is lower, and the signal needs to be equalized according to the RIAA equalization curve for playback, this component brings the voltage up, and performs the equalization, so you can plug it into any regular pre-amp. In the past, the phono stage was frequently included in integrated amplifiers, preamps and receivers, but this is more unusual nowadays, as turntables
A phono pre-amp is also often referred to as a phono stage, or RIAA stage.
<br><Br>
<b>Headphone amplifier</b>
The purpose of a headphone amplifier is to provide suitable output for driving a pair of headphones.
All devices with a headphone output has a headphone amplifier built in, whether it is a smartphone, CD player, portable media player, or other device, so when the term "headphone amplifier" is used, it almost exclusively refers to a standalone headphone amplifier.
A standalone headphone amplifier is typically used because some headphones (in particular high-end headphones) are hard to drive to sufficient loudness levels.

<h1>Amplifier topologies</h1>
<p>
<b>Class A</b>
Transistors (valve or solid state) are always conducting current. Can be single ended or push-pull. Class A amplifiers are the least efficient, as they consume significant amounts of power even when quiescent. However, due to the lack of crossover distortion, they are highly regarded by audiophiles. Generally only produced by very high-end manufacturers.
<br><br><b>Class B</b>
Two transistors hand off operation so that neither are on at the same time. Not used in audio.
<br><br><b>Class AB</b>
The most common topology for audio amplifiers. Transistors are biased so that they are not both on continuously, but do overlap in their operation. Can be biased to differing amounts. More efficient than class A (usually ~40%).
<br><br><b>Class C</b>
Not used in audio.
<br><br><b>Class D</b>
Switching amplifier. The transistor is switched on and off very rapidly (in the MHz to GHz range) Signal is then fed through a low pass filter to reconstruct the original waveform. Very efficient (up to ~98%) and easy to build high power designs. In the past, Class D amplifiers have had higher levels of distortion than A and AB, but more recent designs are comparable in performance to good class AB amplifiers.
<br><br><b>Other classes</b>
Class G is a sub-type of Class AB with voltage rails that can switch to a higher voltage, boosting output power.<br>
Class H is also a sub-type of Class AB with voltage rails that track the waveform above their normal voltage.<br>
Class T is a proprietary implementation of Class D designed by Tripath.
